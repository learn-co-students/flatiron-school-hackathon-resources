# Flatiron School's Guide to Hacking
[Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) offers immersive programs in Software Engineering, Data Science, and UX/UI Design, online or on campuses in the US, UK, and Australia.  This is our work-in-progress guide to building an awesome hackathon project.

## Getting Started
Guides to downloading and installing the relevant software. *These guides were designed for our students, so they make references to "Learn" (our learning management system) which you can ignore.*

**Software Engineering:** The stack we teach in our Software Engineering program is Ruby on Rails on the backend with a SQLite or PostgreSQL database, and React on the frontend.

 - [Software Engineering Windows Setup Instructions (using Virtual Box)](https://help.learn.co/en/articles/1489324-setting-up-linux-virtual-box)
 
**Data Science:** The stack we teach in our Data Science program is Python with Anaconda for package management, Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis, and packages including NumPy, Pandas, and SciKit Learn for generating insights.
