# Flatiron School's Guide to Hacking
[Flatiron School](https://flatironschool.com/) offers immersive programs in Software Engineering, Data Science, and UX/UI Design, online or on campuses in the US, UK, and Australia.  This is our work-in-progress guide to building an awesome hackathon project.

## Getting Started
Guides to downloading and installing the relevant software. *These guides were designed for our students, so they make references to "Learn" (our learning management system) which you can ignore.*

**Software Engineering:** The stack we teach in our Software Engineering program is Ruby on Rails on the backend with a SQLite or PostgreSQL database, and React on the frontend.

## Hackathon Resources
Links to helpful resources to use during a hackathon, curated but not created by Flatiron School.

### Software Tools
 - [Ruby on Rails Scaffolding](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/v3.2/getting_started.html#getting-up-and-running-quickly-with-scaffolding) — Make an entire dynamic website (database, models, views, controllers) with a few commands in the terminal
 - [Start Bootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com/) — Free Bootstrap templates to make your website look polished without frontend design skills

### Data Sources
 - [Data Is Plural](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wZhPLMCHKJvwOkP4juclhjFgqIY8fQFMemwKL2c64vk/edit#gid=0) — A spreadsheet of links to lots of different data sets
 - [City of Seattle Open Data Portal](https://data.seattle.gov/) — All kinds of city data, from the animal shelter to the library to the courts
